            In the heart of the jungle, back in '85, 
            <br>
            Lived an orangutan with the coolest vibe.
            <br>
            He wore baggy pants and a jacket so bright,
            <br>
            Under neon lights, he was quite the sight.
            <br><br/>
            Bananas? He'd scoff, with a look so sour,
            <br>
            "Not for me," he'd say, "not now, not this hour."
            <br>
            He craved the beats, the rhythm, and flow,
            <br>
            Hip-hop was his love, this you must know.
